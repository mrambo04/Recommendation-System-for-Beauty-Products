 # 💄 All Beauty Product Recommendation System

## 📘 Project Overview  
This project presents a recommendation system tailored for beauty products, leveraging user-preferences and product metadata to generate personalized suggestions. The system combines collaborative filtering and content-based methods to deliver relevant product recommendations in the beauty domain.

## 🎯 Objective    
To build and deploy a machine-learning-based recommendation engine that helps users discover beauty products aligned to their tastes and past behaviour, thereby enhancing user engagement and conversion rates. 
     
## 🧰 Tools & Technologies   
- Python   
- Pandas, NumPy   
- Scikit-Learn  
- Cosine Similarity, TF-IDF     
- Jupyter Notebook   
- (Optional: Streamlit / Flask for deployment)  

## 🧮 Approach  
1. **Data Ingestion & Exploration** – Gather and examine product metadata (category, brand, features), user ratings/feedback.   
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, normalize features, encode categorical data.   
3. **Feature Engineering** – Extract meaningful features (brand affinity, product category similarity, user behaviour patterns).  
4. **Recommendation Model**  
   - Content-based filtering using product features and user profiles.  
   - Collaborative filtering using user-item interaction matrix and similarity metrics.  
   - Hybrid approach combining both methods for enhanced accuracy.  
5. **Evaluation** – Use metrics such as Precision@K, Recall@K, Mean Average Precision (MAP) to quantify recommendation quality.  
6. **Results & Insights** – Analyze recommendation lists, identify what works, what can be improved.

## 📈 Key Results  
- Achieved **Precision** and **Recall** using the hybrid model.  
- Top features driving recommendations: brand loyalty score, product category similarity, user historical ratings.  
- Deployed prototype UI allowing users to receive top-5 product suggestions in under 2 seconds.

## 🌐 Real-World Application  
This recommendation system can be integrated into an e-commerce or beauty-tech platform to:  
- Increase user engagement by surfacing relevant products quickly.  
- Improve conversion rates through personalised product suggestions.  
- Assist product discovery for new users by leveraging the hybrid model’s cold-start handling.  
- Provide analytics for brands on how users respond to product features and recommendations.
